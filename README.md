# Parallel-Array-List
I've made a data structure that I call a Parallel-Array-List (PAL), It's most certainly used in many high performance projects as it's just a bunch or arrays strapped together with a nice interface. I'm going to be using with my raytracer as a structure for all the data needed for the raytracer (framebuffer and geometrys') It's suitable for when you have a large number of objects of a particular type (triangles, spheres, pixels, BVH nodes etc) so has applications in many aread outside of raytracing. It's aimed at improving performance of my raytracer by ensuring variables across objects are contiguous (EG geom positions for all triangles are contiguous with eachother and all the colours for the triangles are contiguous with eachother). This CAN improve performance (idk how much, yet to test) by improving cache density of imediatley required info (eg a intersection testing needs only the position values and shading needs only the colours therefore can be split up into different passes (and software pipelined))
